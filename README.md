# angular-chat

This is test chat application. 
The client side built with Angular and server side uses nodeJS.

To run this app:
1) In ```server``` folder run ```npm i``` and ```npm start```
2) In ```client``` folder run ```npm i``` and ```ng serve```
3) The app will be available on ```http://localhost:4200```

To write message to bot, you need to click on menu button while logged in and select "Write our support hero". The bot should apper in the chat window.

I've spent pretty much time on styles to make this application look nice, so there's no time left to integrate chat bot features like Google Translate.
